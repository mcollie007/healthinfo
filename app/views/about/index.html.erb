				<p>Clinic Square: Connecting users to healthcare information. </p>

				<p>Clinic Square is a final project created by Michael Collie-Acasio for the Codecademy Labs. This web service was built to connect individuals to a health center in their community. This service will enable itâ€™s users to find this information via the web and sms messaging.</p>

				<p>This project is a remix of the HRSA.gov "<a href="http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/Search_HCC.aspx">Find a Health Center</a>", website. This has the same search function, with an added feature: SMS messaging. The messaging feature allows a user to send a keyword with a location identifier ie. zip code or city name. The web service then returns the search results to the user.</p>
