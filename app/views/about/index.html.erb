				<p>Clinic Square: Connecting users to healthcare information. </p>

				<p>Clinic Square is a final project created by Michael Collie-Acasio for the Codecademy Labs. The web service was built to connect individuals to a health center in their community. This service will enable itâ€™s users to find this information via the web and sms messaging.</p>

				<p>This web serivice is a remix of the HRSA.gov find a clinic site. This has the same search function, with an added feature: SMS messaging. SMS messaging allows a user to send a keyword with a location identifier ie. zip code or city name. The web service then returns the search results to the user.</p>
